## 1. Project Summary

EasyShop is a full-stack e-commerce application developed using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **MySQL**. It provides a RESTful API backend with the following core features:

- Category and product management  
- Shopping cart functionality  
- User profile handling  
- Order processing  
- Full CRUD operations  
- Secure user authentication  

Users can browse, search, and purchase products via API endpoints.

## 2. Running the Application
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c59ea0aa-1abd-41f7-9bf7-7a7bda06b7b6)
### Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK 17 or higher)  
- MySQL Database  
- Postman *(optional, for API testing)*  
- IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse  

### Configuration

Before running the application, update your `application.properties` file with your MySQL credentials:

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/
spring.datasource.username=<your-username>
spring.datasource.password=<your-password>



### Steps to Run

1. Clone the repository:

git clone - link
cd capstone-3


2. Run the application using Maven:

./mvnw spring-boot:run


3. Access the API or frontend:

- API Base URL: `http://localhost:8080`
- Frontend (optional): `http://localhost:8080/index.html`

## 3. Project Planning and Workflow

### GitHub Project Board
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b4c7d98-a617-41fc-86d1-89e7da5e701b)

The development workflow was managed using a GitHub Project board with the following columns:

- **Backlog** ‚Äì Items yet to be started  
- **In Progress** ‚Äì Tasks currently being worked on  
- **Review** ‚Äì Features pending feedback or testing  
- **Done** ‚Äì Completed features and fixes  

### Roadmap

**Day 1-2**  
- Configure the development environment  
- Set up authentication  
- Establish database connectivity  

**Day 3-5**  
- Implement RESTful APIs for categories and products  

**Day 3** 
- Incomplete **
- Develop shopping cart, user profile, and order modules  
- Conduct integration testing to ensure system cohesion  

---
## Development Phases

- **Authentication**: Implemented `register` and `login` endpoints to secure user access to the API.  
- **CRUD Operations**: Created RESTful endpoints for managing categories, products, shopping carts, user profiles, and orders.  
- **Product Filtering**: Enabled dynamic filtering of products via query parameters.  
- **Testing**: Validated functionality of all endpoints using Postman.

---

## Tools Used

- **Spring Boot** ‚Äì Backend application framework  
- **MySQL** ‚Äì Relational database management  
- **Postman** ‚Äì API testing and validation  
- **GitHub Projects** ‚Äì Project and task management

---

## Challenges Faced

- **Database Connection Errors**: The application initially failed to connect to MySQL due to incorrect configuration in the properties file.  
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Designing flexible filtering logic using query parameters proved more complex than expected.  


---

## Solutions 

- Fixed database configuration by carefully reviewing `application.properties`.  
- Used Spring Boot's `@RequestParam` to support dynamic product filtering.  
- Maintained a prioritized to-do list and leveraged tight feedback loops to maintain progress and adapt quickly.
  
### Bug Fixes

**1. Search Filter Issue**  
The search functionality was returning incorrect results due to a mismatch in the number of prepared statement parameters. We resolved this by aligning the parameters correctly and writing unit tests to help identify and confirm the fix.
**2. Duplicate Laptop Listings**  
The application was displaying three identical laptop entries due to a logic error in the product update method. Instead of updating the existing product, it was incorrectly invoking the `CREATE` ope

## Implemented Methods

### üóÇÔ∏è CategoriesController
- `getProductsById(categoryId)` ‚Äì Retrieves products based on a specific category ID  
- `addCategory()` ‚Äì Adds a new category (**Admin-only access**)  
- `updateCategory()` ‚Äì Updates an existing category (**Admin-only access**)  
- `deleteCategory()` ‚Äì Deletes a category (**Admin-only access**)  

### üóÑÔ∏è MySqlCategories (DAO Layer)
- `getAllCategories()` ‚Äì Retrieves all available categories  
- `getById(categoryId)` ‚Äì Retrieves a single category by its ID  
- `createCategory()` ‚Äì Adds a new category (**Admin-only access**)  
- `updateCategory(categoryId)` ‚Äì Updates a category using its ID  
- `deleteCategory(categoryId)` ‚Äì Removes a category using its ID

## Lessons Learned

### üîê Cross-Origin and Security Annotations
- `@CrossOrigin`: Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) so that frontend apps can make requests to the backend from different domains.  
  - *Example*: `AuthenticationController.java` in `org.yearup.controllers`  
- `@PreAuthorize`: Restricts access to certain endpoints to authenticated users.  
  - *Example*: `OrdersController.java` uses `@PreAuthorize("isAuthenticated()")`

### üß∞ Leveraging Spring Boot Annotations
- Key annotations like `@Autowired`, `@RequestMapping`, and `@RequestParam` streamlined development and enhanced code organization.  
  - *Example*: `ProductsController.java` in `org.yearup.controllers`

### üî¨ API Testing with Postman
- Used Postman to simulate and verify API requests, organize test collections, and ensure endpoint reliability.  
  - *Reference*: See ‚ÄúHow to Run‚Äù section above

### üíª Frontend Development
- Built a lightweight user interface using **HTML** and **JavaScript** for an intuitive customer experience.  
  - *Example*: `index.html` and related JS files in the `easyshop-frontend` directory

### ‚öôÔ∏è Efficient Data Handling with Java Streams
- Utilized Java Streams to filter, map, and process data concisely and effectively.  
  - *Example*: `ShoppingCartController.java` in `org.yearup.controllers` uses `stream().filter().map().collect()`
